# Wander Maps
## ✈️ An Itinerary Creation Tool 
WanderMaps was created to help you stay organized so you can worry less and wander more. We all know the struggle of traveling. You spend days, weeks, and months, planning the perfect trip. You invest your time, energ, and money into creating an experience of a lifetime only to get to your destination and try to remember and keep track of everything you wanted to do and enjoy. WanderMaps allows users to create a trip and add fun and exciting expereiences to each trip. It's as easy as plugging in a few details and WanderMaps creates an itinerary with everything listed. You can keep track of dates, activities, even addresses all in one spot. It's also a great way to remember what you did when you last vacationed. Instead of frantically keeping track of activities,  sit back, relax and enjoy making memories. 

## Features:
- User can keep track of all trips, past and present.
- When creating a trip the user can track what's most important: arrival and departure dates, lodging arangements, and specific locations.
- After creating a trip, user can then add fun events to the trip to include date of event, address, activity, and descriptions.
- Generated your itinerary and need to add more? It's as easy as clicking a button. 

## Most Proud of:
- Building an entire Java application using Spring. I've never done a project of the magnitude on my own. Learning Java in less than 3 months and applying it so quickly has been the experience of a lifetime. 
- More specifically I'm the most proud of my ability to create native queries to get the most important information from my database. It really gave me the real full-stack experience. 
- I am also most proud of my failures. There were plenty of roadblocks along the way but learning how to look-up errors, debugging, and asking for help when necessary really taught me a lot. 

## Features I'd Add In The Future
- Creating multiple trips within one form. 
- A way for users to interact with eachother and plan trips together. 
- A message board for users to write about their trip and make recommendations. 
- An alert system for users to get alerted when a trip or event is coming up.
